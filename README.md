# N++ Death Counter

N++ Death Counter, hence its name, counts how many deaths you have and outputs it to a file. This is useful for live-streamers who always want more information on their streams. (Windows only)

## Building

Just compile `main.cpp` and run.

## Usage

Two files are created when opened: `npp_death_count_session.txt`, which counts the deaths from 0 since opened, and `npp_death_count_alltime.txt`, which counts the deaths of all time. You decide whatever file you want to your streaming program to read or maybe both.
